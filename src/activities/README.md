# 🔄 Recursion Lab — Linked Lists Activities

Welcome! This document lists the **four lab activities** for practicing **recursion** on linked lists. All activities must be solved using **recursive approaches only**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Solutions are not uploaded yet. Solution videos will be linked here once available. Try solving them on your own before checking the videos.

## 🔢 Activity 01 — Sum Elements in SLL

**Problem:** Compute the sum of all elements in a singly linked list using recursion.

**Input:** Head of a singly linked list.
**Output:** An integer representing the sum of all node values.

**Edge-cases to consider:**

- Empty list → sum = 0.
- Single-node list → sum = value of that node.
- Lists with multiple nodes → sum of all nodes.

## 🔍 Activity 02 — Find Last Node in CLL

**Problem:** Return the last node of a **circular linked list** using recursion.

**Input:** Head of a circular linked list.
**Output:** The node that points back to the head (last node).

**Edge-cases to consider:**

- Empty list → return `null`.
- Single-node circular list → the node itself is the last.
- Multi-node circular list → correctly identify the last node.

## 🔢 Activity 03 — Count Nodes in CLL

**Problem:** Count the number of nodes in a circular linked list using recursion.

**Input:** Head of a circular linked list.
**Output:** Integer count of nodes.

**Edge-cases to consider:**

- Empty list → count = 0.
- Single-node circular list → count = 1.
- Multi-node circular list → ensure recursion stops correctly without infinite loops.

## 🔁 Activity 04 — Reverse SLL

**Problem:** Reverse a singly linked list using recursion (change pointers, not node values).

**Input:** Head of a singly linked list.
**Output:** Head of the reversed linked list.

**Edge-cases to consider:**

- Empty list → head remains `null`.
- Single-node list → reversed list is the same node.
- Multiple nodes → ensure all pointers are correctly reversed recursively.

## 📌 Instructions

1. Implement **recursive solutions** only.
2. Test edge-cases before submitting.
3. Once solution videos are uploaded, watch them to compare your approach.
4. All activities are independent — you can start with any of them.
